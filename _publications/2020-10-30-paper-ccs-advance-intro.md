This research utilizes sentimental analysis to recover APIs’ integration assumptions (IAs) from documentation and translates them to verification code for a compliance check on the softwares integrating these IAs. We implemented this design and evaluated it on 5 popular libraries (OpenSSL, SQLite, libpcap, libdbus and libxml2) and 39 real­world applications. 193 API misuses were detected at the end.
