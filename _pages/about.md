I am a Ph.D. student in the School of Computing at the National University of Singapore (NUS), working with [Prateek Saxena](https://www.comp.nus.edu.sg/~prateeks/) in the [KISP Lab](https://kisp-nus.github.io/). My research focuses on automatic program translation, especially translating C to safe and idiomatic Rust. Here is my [CV](/files/CV_Ruishi_Li.pdf). I'm working on the [Automatic Program Translation project](https://kisp-nus.github.io/projects/apt).

**News** 📣 2025 Dec – Released *ACToR*, an adversarial multi-agent system that automatically translates real-world C utilities to Rust with >90% test pass rate ([Github repo](https://github.com/kisp-nus/ACToR)). Looking forward to your feedback!

<!-- Before joining NUS, I received my M.S. from the Institute of Information Engineering (IIE), University of Chinese Academy of Sciences (UCAS) and B.E. from the school of Cyber Science and Engineering, Wuhan University (WHU). -->

Research Interests
------
- Software Security
- Code Translation
- Large Language Models
<!-- I am broadly interested in computer security and software engineering (e.g., software security, OS security, machine learning security, and hardware security). I have some experience in vulnerability discovery and natural language processing. Now I’m working on code translation. -->
